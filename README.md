Hi, 
Here I came up with a #66days challenge for myself. 
The topics can be anything, Machine learning topics, the Mathematics behind the AI algorithms, Data structures and Algorithms etc you name it.
The goal of this challenge is to ensure I learn something new everyday and be consistant. I plan to spend atleast 5 minutes everyday and track the progress here in Git.
